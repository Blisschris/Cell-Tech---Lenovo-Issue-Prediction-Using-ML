# 🛠 Lenovo Laptop Issue Classifier

 created this project to simulate a real-world machine learning classification system. It predicts common Lenovo laptop issues based on hardware specifications such as RAM, processor, screen size, battery life, and price, using a Random Forest model. This helps demonstrate how predictive modeling can support diagnostics and service optimization.
